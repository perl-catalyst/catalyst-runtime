        - Test for using Moose in components which have a non-Moose base class
          Fixed by 349cda in Moose 0.78 (t0m)
        - Fix deprecation message for Catalyst::Dispatcher to refer
          to the class actually calling the deprecated method. RT#45741 (t0m)
        - Clarify limitations of $request->base and $request->secure.
          (Phil Mitchell)

5.80003 2009-04-29 16:23:53
        - Various POD tweaks. (hdp, dandv)
        - Fix formatting error in the regex fallback warning. (rafl)
        - Convert the dispatcher's and restarter engine's BUILD method to
          attribute builders to not override the BUILD method from
          MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast. (rafl)
        - Fix classes without metaclasses restarting, when not using
          B::Hooks::OP::Check::StashChange (t0m)
        - Fix the unattached chain debug table for endpoints with no
          parents at all. (rafl)
        - Turn of test aggregation by default. Only aggregate if the
          AGGREGATE_TESTS environment variable is set and a recent
          Test::Aggregate is available. (rafl)
        - Bump to MooseX::MethodAttributes 0.09, to gain the
          get_nearest_methods_with_attributes method allowing methods without
          attributes in a subclass to override those with attributes in a
          superclass. This fixes CatalystX::CRUD's method of overriding /
          disabling functionality from base controllers. (t0m)
        - Bump HTTP::Request::AsCGI dependency to avoid broken version (t0m)
        - Bump Moose dependency to latest version to fix metaclass
          incompatibility issues in some cases. (t0m)
        - Additional tests for setup_stats method. (t0m)
        - Fix log levels in Catalyst::Log to be properly additive. (t0m)
        - Fix RT#43375 by sorting results before testing them (t0m)
        - Fixes for uri_for_action when using Catalyst::DispatchType::Regex
          + tests from RT#39369 (norbi)
        - Partial rewrite and reoganisation of the C3 docs in
          Catalyst::Upgrading based on feedback from kiffin (t0m)
        - If you make your application class immutable and turn off
          constructor inlining, Catalyst will die and tell you pass
          the (replace_constructor => 1) argument to
          make_immutable. (Dave Rolsky)

5.80002 2009-04-22 01:28:36
        - Fix CATALYST_DEBUG and MYAPP_DEBUG environment variables
          turning debuging on if defined, rather than if set.
          They now force debugging on or off, taking precedence over
          configuration in your application. (t0m)
          - Tests for this (t0m)
        - pass replace_constructor to the immutable call to ensure
          applications get a Moose constructor rather than a C::A one
        - Fix issues with restarting the application class due to C3 failures
          on perl 5.10 (t0m)
        - Work around issues in Moose with initialization order of multiple
          levels of non-Moose classes inheriting from a Moose class (t0m)
          - Test for this
        - Add backwards compatibility method for Catalyst::Log->body, which
          has been made private (t0m)
        - Fix so that calling $c->req->parameters(undef) does not flatten
          the request parameters with undef + test (t0m)
        - Fix so that width of table of unattached actions for debugging
          ::DispatchType::Chained varies according to your terminal width
          (Oleg Kostyuk)
        - Fix warning message about linearized @ISA in Catalyst::Component
          (Emanuele Zeppieri)
        - Require MX::MethodAttributes 0.06 to avoid issues with saying
          use base 'Catalyst::Controller'; use Moose; losing actions (t0m)
        - Fix all of t0m's typos in ::Upgrading and ::Delta (hobbs)

5.80001 2009-04-18 22:18
        - Don't inline the constructor for Catalyst::Log to avoid a
          warning on recent Moose versions.
        - Add delta documentation
        - Clean up recursion errors
        - Extra cross links in dispatch types POD (Ian Wells)
        - Test uri_with clears query params when they are set to undef
          (Ian Wells)
        - Complain about old Catalyst::Devel versions which generated
          ->setup(qw/-Debug... etc. as this is not recommended (t0m)

5.8000_07 2009-04-12 13:37
        - Add the Catalyst::Dispatcher->dispatch_type method (ash)
        - Throw an exception rather than loading an app if an action
          tries to chain to itself (t0m)
          - Tests for this
        - Change the $c->visit and $c->go methods to optionally take
          CaptureArgs, making them useful to call ActionChains with (t0m)
          - Tests for this (radek)
        - Fix _invoke_as_component method to find the proper action instance
          for dispatchable actions so that ->visit or ->going to ActionChains
          with qw/Class::Name method_name/ works correctly (t0m)
          - Tests for this (radek)
        - Added Catalyst::Test::ctx_request to be able to inspect
          the context object after a request is made (Jos Boumans)
        - debug() POD rewrite (jhannah)
        - Change the warning when you have conflicting components to
          present a list (t0m)
        - Move NEXT use and testing deprecated features out to its own
          test application so that the main TestApp isn't polluted with
          spurious warnings (t0m)
        - Add a warning for the old ::[MVC]:: style naming scheme (t0m)
          - Test for this (t0m)
        - Kill Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT warnings for the Catalyst:: namespace
          in production versions (t0m)
        - Tidy up Catalyst::ClassData to ensure that all components get
          the correct metaclass (t0m)
        - Make MyApp.pm restartable by unsetting setup_finished in
          the restarter process (t0m)
        - Non-naive implementation of making mutable on restart using
          B::Hooks::OP::Check::StashChange if installed (t0m)
          - Tests for this (t0m)
        - Naive implementation of making all components mutable in the
          forked restart watcher process so native Moose apps using
          immutable restart correctly. (t0m)
          - Tests for this (t0m)
        - Bump Moose dependency to 0.70 so that we avoid nasty surprises
          with is_class_loaded and perl 5.80 when you Moosify MyApp.pm (t0m)
        - Clarify that request arguments aren't unescaped automatically
          (Simon Bertrang) (Closes RT#41153)
        - Don't require C3 for the MRO test (rafl)

          changes. Also depend on the latest Class::MOP. (rafl)
        - Add $c->uri_for_action method. (hdp)
        - Don't stringify the meta method. Use its name instead. (rafl)
        - Use MooseX::MethodAttributes::Inheritable to contain action
          attributes. This means that attributes are now represented in the MOP,
          allowing method modifiers on actions to work as expected. (rafl)
        - Provide a reasonable API in Catalyst::Controller for working with
          and registering actions, allowing a controller sub-class to replace
          subroutine attributes for action declerations with an alternate
          syntax. (rafl/hdp)
        - Instantiate correct sub-class of Moose::Meta::Class for non-Moose
          components where Catalyst forces the creation of a metaclass instance.
          This is more correct, and avoids metaclass incompatibility in complex
          cases (t0m)
          - Tests for this (t0m)
        - Use of deprecated Catalyst::Base now warns. (t0m)
        - Add uri_with tests (gphat)

          (Closes RT#38544)
        - Use the way documented by IO::Socket::INET to get the error message
          after trying to create a listening socket (rafl) (Closes RT#41828)
        - Don't ignore SIGCHLD while handling requests with the dev server
          (rafl) (Closes RT#42962)

        - Fixes for FastCGI with IIS 6.0 (janus)
        - Passing request method exported by Catalyst::Test an extra
          parameter used to be ignored, but started breaking if the parameter

          it isn't a hashref (t0m)
        - Fix request argumentss getting corrupted if you override the 
          dispatcher and call an action which detaches (for 
          Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL) (t0m)
        - Fix calling use Catalyst::Test 'MyApp' 'foo' which used to work,

        - Remove unused action_container_class attribute from 
          Catalyst::Dispatcher (t0m)
        - Replace {_body} instance access with calls to _body accessors (t0m)
        - Add backwards compatibility alias methods for private attributes on 
          Catalyst::Dispatcher which used to be public. Needed by 
          Catalyst::Plugin::Server and  Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL 
          (t0m)

          - Tests for this (t0m)
        - Change streaming test to serve itself rather than 01use.t, making 
          test sync for engines easier (t0m)
        - Refactor capturing of $app from Catalyst::Controller into
          Catalyst::Component::ApplicationAttribute for easier reuse in other

        - Make the test suites YAML dependency optional (Florian Ragwitz)
        - Make debug output show class name for the engine and dispatcher
          rather than the stringified ref. (t0m)
        - Make MyApp immutable at the end of the scope after the setup
          method is called, fixing issues with plugins which have their 
          own new methods by inlining a constructor on MyApp (t0m)
          - Test for this and method modifiers in MyApp (t0m)
        - Fix bug causing Catalyst::Request::Upload's basename method
          to return undef (t0m)

          to force new version which fixes a lot of plugins (t0m)
        - Make log levels additive, and add documentation and tests
          for the setup_log method, which previously had none.
          Sewn together by t0m from two patches provided by David E. Wheeler
        - Switch an around 'new' in Catalyst::Controller to a BUILDARGS
          method as it's much neater and more obvious what is going on (t0m)
        - Add a clearer method on request and response _context 
          attributes, and use if from ::Engine rather than deleting
          the key from the instance hash (t0m)

          Catalyst::Engine::CGI: _header_buf
          Catalyst::Engine::HTTP: options, _keepalive, _write_error

          Catalyst::Stats: tree
          (t0m)
        - Fix issues in Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI 
          and any other components which import (or define) their 
          own meta method by always explicitly calling
          Class::MOP::Object->meta inside Catalyst (t0m)
          - Add test for this (t0m)

        - Additional tests to ensure upload temp files are deleted (andyg)
        - Remove use of NEXT from the test suite, except for one case

5.7099_03 2008-07-20 10:10:00
        - Fix regressions for regexp fallback in model(), view() and controller()
        - Added the supplied argument to the regexp fallback warning for easier
          debugging
        - Ensure ACCEPT_CONTEXT is called for results from component()

5.7099_02 2008-07-16 19:10:00
        - Added PathPrefix attribute
        - Removed Catalyst::Build; we've long since moved to Module::Install
        - Updated Catalyst::Test docs to mention the use of HTTP::Request
          objects (Rafael Kitover)

5.7099_01 2008-06-25 22:36:00
        - Refactored component resolution (component(), models(), model(), et al). We now
          throw warnings for two reasons:
          1) model() or view() was called with no arguments, and two results are returned
             -- set default_(model|view), current_(model|view) or current_(model|view)_instance
             instead
          2) you call a component resolution method with a string, and it resorts to a regexp 
             fallback wherein a result is returned -- if you really want to search, call the
             method with a regex as the argument
        - remove 0-length query string components so warnings aren't thrown (RT #36428)
        - Update HTTP::Body dep so that the uploadtmp config value will work (RT #22540)
        - Fix for LocalRegex when used in the Root controller
        - Get some of the optional_* tests working from dirs with spaces (RT #26455)
        - Fix Catalyst::Utils::home() when application .pm is in the current dir (RT #34437)
        - Added the ability to remove parameters in req->uri_with() by passing in
          an undef value (RT #34782)
        - Added $c->go, to do an internal redispatch to another action, while retaining the
          contents of the stash

5.7014  2008-05-25 15:26:00
