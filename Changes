# This file documents the revision history for Perl extension Catalyst.

5.80021 2010-03-03 23:02:01

  Bug fixed:
   - $c->uri_for will now escape unsafe characterss in captures
     ($c->request->captures) and correctly encode utf8 charracters.

5.80020 2010-02-04 06:51:18

  New features:
    - Allow components to specify additional components to be set up by
      overriding the expand_modules method. (Oliver Charles)

5.80019 2010-01-29 01:04:09

  Bug fixed:
   - Calls to $c->uri_for with private paths as strings (e.g.
     $c->uri_for('controller/action', 'arg1', 'arg2') ) no longer have
     / encoded to %2F. This is due to $c->uri_for('static', 'css/foo', $bar)
     which should not be encoded.
     Calls with an action object (rather than a string), or uri_for action
     will still encode / in args and captures to %2F

   - The above noted / => %2F encoding in uri_for_action or uri_for with
     an action object has been fixed to not just encode the first slash in
     any set of args/captures.

   - nginx and lighttpd FCGI requests with URI encoded sections as the first
     path part have been fixed to operate correctly.

   - A source of bogus warnings in Catalyst::Component::BUILDARGS has been
     removed.

  Documentation:
   - Improve the documentation about -Home and how Catalyst finds the home path
     for applications.
   - Various minor typo fixes.

  New features:
   - Allow passing additional arguments to action constructors.

5.80018 2010-01-12 22:24:20

  Bug fixed:
   - Call ->canonical on URI derived from $ENV{REQUEST_URI} to get
     paths correctly decoded. This bug was previously hidden by a bug
     in HTTP::Request::AsCGI.

  Documentation:
   - Clarify that uri_for_action works on private paths, with example.
   - Clarify documentation about debug

  Deprecations:
   - Saying use Catalyst::Test; (without an application name or () to stop
     the importer running is now deprecated and will issue a warning.
     You should be saying use Catalyst::Test ();

5.80017 2010-01-10 02:27:29

  Documentation:
   - Fix docs for ->forward method when passed a class name - this should
     be a component name (e.g. View::HTML, not a full class name, like
     MyApp::View::HTML).

  Bug fixes:
   - --daemon and -d options to Catalyst::Script::FastCGI are fixed.
   - Fix the debug dump for applications which use Catalyst::Plugin::Session
     (RT#52898)
   - Fix regression in the case where mod_rewrite is being used to rewrite
     requests into a path below your application base introduced with the
     %2F related fixes in 5.80014_02.
   - Do not crash on SIGHUP if Catalyst::Engine::HTTP->run is not passed the
     argv key in the options hash.
   - Correctly pass the arguments to Catalyst::Script::Server through to
     Catalyst::Engine::HTTP->run so that the server can restart itself
     with the correct options on SIGHUP.
   - Require new MooseX::MethodAttributes to be compatible with Moose
     versions >= 0.93_01
   - Require new MooseX::Role::WithOverloading to be compatible with Moose
     versions >= 0.93_01

  Cleanups:
    - Stop suppressing warnings from Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT now that most plugins
      have been updated to not use NEXT. If you get warnings then please upgrade
      your components or log a bug with the component author if an upgrade is
      not available. The Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT documentation contains information
      about how to suppress the warnings in your application if you need to.

5.80016 2009-12-11 23:23:33

  Bug fixes:

   - Fix slurping a file to work correctly with binary on Win32 in the
     encoding test controller.

  Bug fixes in the new scripts (for applications which have been upgraded):

   - Allow --restartdirectory as an option for the Server script, for
     backwards compatibility. (Dave Rolsky)
   - The --host option for the server script defaulted to localhost, rather
     than listening on all interfaces, which was the previous default. (Dave
     Rolsky)
   - Restore -p option for pid file in the FastCGI server script.
   - Fix the script environment variables MYAPP_PORT and MYAPP_RELOAD RT#52604
   - Fix aliasing applications under non-root paths with mod_rewrite in
     some apache versions where %ENV{SCRIPT_NAME} is set to the real name of
     the script, by using $ENV{REDIRECT_URL} which contains the non-rewritten
     URI.
   - Fix usage display when myapp_create.pl is run with no arguments. RT#52630

  New features:

   - The __MOP__ hash element is suppressed from being dumped fully
     (and instead stringified) when dumping the error screen to be
     less packed with information of no use.

  Documentation:

   - Fix Pod nits (RT#52370)

5.80015 2009-12-02 15:13:54
  Bug fixes:
   - Fix bug in Catalyst::Engine which would cause a request parsing to end
     prematurely in the hypothetical case where calling $engine->read returned
     the single character '0'.
   - Fix failing tests when combined with new HTTP::Request::AsCGI

  Documentation:
   - Improved documentation on read and read_chunk methods in Catalyst::Engine.
   - Fix reversal of SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO in previously correct nginx
     FastCGI documentation introduced in _02.

5.80014_02 2009-12-01 00:55:23
  Bug fixes:
   - Fix reporting the wrong Content-Length if the response body is an
     upgraded string. Strings mean the same thing whether or not they are
     upgraded, may get upgraded even after they are encoded, and will
     produce the same output either way, but bytes::length returns too big
     values for upgraded strings containing characters >127
   - Fix t/live_fork.t with bleadperl (RT#52100)
   - Set $ENV{PATH_INFO} from $ENV{REQUEST_URI} combined with
     $ENV{SCRIPT_NAME} if possible. This is many web servers always fully
     decode PATH_INFO including URI reserved characters. This allows us to
     tell foo%2cbar from foo%252cbar, and fixes issues with %2F in paths
     being incorrectly decoded, resulting in too many path parts (rather
     than 1 path part containing a /, on some web servers (at least nginx).
     (RT#50082)
   - Require new HTTP::Request::AsCGI so that it fully decodes $ENV{PATH_INFO}
     in non CGI contexts. (RT#50082)

  Refactoring / cleanups:
   - NoTabs and Pod tests moved to t/author so that they're not run
     (and then skipped) normally.

  Documentation:
    - Fix Pod nits in Catalyst::Response (RT#51818)

5.80014_01 2009-11-22 20:01:23

  Bug fixes:
   - Filehandle now forced to binmode in CGI and FastCGI engines. This appears
     to correct some UTF-8 issues, but may break people's code which relies
     on the old behaviour.

  Refactoring / cleanups:
   - Plugins which inherit from Catalyst::Controller or Catalyst::Component
     are deprecated and now issue warnings.

5.80014 2009-11-21 02:51:14

   Bug fixes:
    - Require MooseX::MethodAttributes 0.17. This in turn requires new
      MooseX::Types to stop warnings in Moose 0.91, and correctly supports
      role combination of roles containing attributed methods.
    - Catalyst::Dispatcher::dispatch_types no longer throws deprecated warnings
      as there is no recommended alternative.
    - Improved the suggested fix warning when component resolution uses regex
      fallback for fully qualified component names.
    - Catalyst::Test::local_request sets ->request on the response.
    - Log flush moved to the end of setup so that roles and plugins which
      hook setup_finalize can log things and have them appear in application
      startup, rather than with the first hit.
    - Require a newer version of LWP to avoid failing tests.
    - Stop warnings when actions are forwarded to during dispatch.
    - Remove warnings for using Catalyst::Dispatcher->dispatch_types as this is a
      valid method to publicly call on the dispatcher.
    - Args ($c->request->args) and CaptureArgs ($c->request->captrues)
      passed to $c->uri_for with an action object ($c->action) will now
      correctly round-trip when args or captures contain / as it is now
      correctly uri encoded to %2F.

  Documentation:
    - Document no-args call to $c->uri_for.
    - Document all top level application configuration parameters.
    - Clarify how to fix actions in your application class (which is
      deprecated and causes warnings).
    - Pod fixes for ContextClosure.
    - Fix documentation for go/visit to reference captures and arguments
      in the correct order.
    - Update $c->forward and $c->state documentation to address scalar
      context.
    - Pod fix in Catalyst::Request (RT#51490)
    - Pod fixes to refer to ::Controller:: rather than ::C:: as the latter
      is deprecated (RT#51489)

  New features:
    - Added disable_component_resolution_regex_fallback config option to
      switch off (deprecated) regex fallback for component resolution.
    - Added an nginx-specific behavior to the FastCGI engine to allow
      proper PATH_INFO and SCRIPT_NAME processing for non-root applications
    - Enable Catalyst::Utils::home() to find home within Dist::Zilla built
      distributions
    - Added the Catalyst::Exception::Interface role defining the interface
      exception classes need to implement.
    - Added Catalyst::Exception::Basic as a basic implementation of
      Catalyst::Exception::Interface and made the existing exception classes
      use it.

  Refactoring / cleanups:
    - Remove documentation for the case_sensitive setting
    - Warning is now emitted at application startup if the case_sensitive
      setting is turned on. This setting is not used by anyone, not
      believed to be useful and adds unnecessary complexity to controllers
      and the dispatcher. If you are using this setting and have good reasons
      why it should stay then you need to be shouting, now.
    - Writing to $c->req->body now fails as doing this never makes sense.

5.80013 2009-09-17 11:07:04

   Bug fixes:
     - Preserve immutable_options when temporarily making a class mutable in
       Catalyst::ClassData as this is needed by new Class::MOP.
       This could have potentially caused issues when using the deprecated runtime
       plugins feature in an application with plugins which define their own new
       method.
     - Require new Moose version and new versions of various dependencies
       to avoid warnings from newest Moose release.
     - Fix go / visit expecting captures and arguments in reverse order.

  Documentation:
     - Rework the $c->go documentation to make it more clear.
     - Additional documentation in Catalyst::Upgrading covering more deprecation
       warnings.

  Refactoring / cleanups:
     - Action methods in the application class are deprecated and applications
       using them will now generate a warning at startup.
     - The -short option has been removed from catalyst.pl, stopping new
       applications from being generated using the ::[MVC]:: naming scheme as
       this is deprecated and generates warnings. RT#49771

5.80012 2009-09-09 19:09:09

  Bug fixes:
     - Fix t/optional_http-server.t test.
     - Fix t/optional_http-server-restart.t test.
     - Fix duplicate components being loaded at setup time, each component is
       now loaded at most once + tests.
     - Fix backward compatibility - hash key configured actions are stored in
       is returned to 'actions'.
     - Fix get_action_methods returning duplicate methods when a method is both
       decorated with method attributes and set as an action in config.

  Refactoring / cleanups:
     - Reduce minimum supported perl version from 5.8.6 to 5.8.4 as there are
       many people still running/testing this version with no known issues.

  Tests:
     - Make the optional_http_server.t test an author only test which must be
       run by authors to stop it being broken again.
     - Fix recursion warnings in the test suites.

5.80011 2009-08-23 13:48:15

  Bug fixes:
      - Remove leftovers of the restarter engine. The removed code caused test
        failures, which weren't apparent for anyone still having an old version
        installed in @INC.

5.80010 2009-08-21 23:32:15

  Bug fixes:
      - Fix and add tests for a regression introduced by 5.80008.
        Catalyst::Engine is now able to send out data from filehandles larger
        than the default chunksize of 64k again.

5.80009 2009-08-21 22:21:08

  Bug fixes:
      - Fix and add tests for generating inner packages inside the COMPONENT
        method, and those packages being correctly registered as components.
        This fixes Catalyst::Model::DBIC among others.

5.80008 2009-08-21 17:47:30

  Bug fixes:
       - Fix replace_constructor warning to actually work if you make your
         application class immutable without that option.
       - Depend on Module::Pluggable 3.9 to prevent a bug wherein components
         in inner packages might not be registered. This especially affected
         tests.
       - Catalyst::Engine::FastCGI - relax the check for versions of Microsoft
         IIS. Provides compatibility with Windows 2008 R2 as well as
         (hopefully) future versions.
       - In tests which depend on the values of environment variables,
         localise the environment, then delete only relevant environment
         variables (RT#48555)
       - Fix issue with Engine::HTTP not sending headers properly in some cases
         (RT#48623)
       - Make Catalyst::Engine write at least once when finalizing the response
         body from a filehandle, even if the write is empty. This avoids fail
         when trying to send out an empty response body from a filehandle.
       - Catalyst::Engine::HTTP - Accept a fully qualified absolute URI in the
         Request-URI of the Request-Line

  Refactoring / cleanups:
       - Deleted the Restarter engine and its Watcher code. Use the
         new Catalyst::Restarter in a recent Catalyst::Devel instead.
       - New unit test for Catalyst::Action 'unit_core_action.t'
       - Bump minimum supported perl version from 5.8.1 to 5.8.6 as there are
         known issues with 5.8.3.
       - Debug output uses dynamic column sizing to create more readable output
         when using a larger $ENV{COLUMNS} setting. (groditi)

  New features:
       - Added private_path method for Catalyst::Action
       - Allow uri_for($controller_instance) which will produce a URI
         for the controller namespace
       - Break setup_components into two more parts: locate_components and
         expand_component_module (rjbs)
       - Allow Components to return anon classed from their COMPONENT method
         correctly, and have action registration work on Controllers returned
         as such by adding a catalyst_component_name accessor for all components
         which returns the component instance's name to be used when building
         actions etc.
       - Adding X-Forwarded-Port to allow the frontend proxy to dictate the
         frontend port (jshirley)
       - Added Catalyst::Stats->created accessor for the time at the start of
         the request.

  Documentation:
       - Fix POD to refer to ->config(key => $val), rather than
         ->config->{key} = $val, as the latter form is deprecated.
       - Clearer docs for the 'uri_for' method.
       - Fix POD refering to CGI::Cookie. We're using CGI::Simple::Cookie.
         (Forrest Cahoon)

5.80007 2009-06-30 23:54:34

  Bug fixes:
       - Don't mangle query parameters passed to uri_for
         - Tests for this (Byron Young + Amir Sadoughi)
       - Inherited controller methods can now be specified in
         config->{action(s)}
       - Assigning an undef response body no longer produces warnings
       - Fix C3 incompatibility bug caused if you use Moose in MyApp.pm and
         add Catalyst to the right hand side of this in @ISA.
       - Make Catalyst.pm implement the Component::ApplicationAttribute
         interface so defining actions in MyApp.pm works again, if the
         actions have attributes that cause $self->_application to be used
         (like ActionClass).

  New features:
       - Add optional second argument to uri_with which appends to existing
         params rather than replacing them. (foo=1 becomes foo=1&foo=2 when
         uri_with({ foo => 2 }, { mode => 'append' }) is called on a foo=1
         URI.

5.80006 2009-06-29 23:37:47

  Bug fixes:
        - Revert change to URL encode things passed into $c->uri_for
          Args and CaptureArgs as this causes breakage to pre-existing
          applications.
        - Remove use of Test::MockObject as it doesn't install from CPAN
          in some environments.
        - Remove use of dclone to deep copy configs and replace with
          Catalyst::Utils::merge_hashes which has the same effect, of
          ensuring child classes don't inherit their parent's config,
          except works correctly with closures.
        - Add Class::C3::reinitialize into Catalyst::Test to avoid weird
          bugs in ctx_request (bokutin in RT#46459)
        - Fix issues with _parse_PathPrefix_attr method in Catalyst::Controller
          (jasonk in RT#42816)
        - Fix bugs with action sorting:
          - Path actions sorted so that the most specific wins.
          - Action methods named default and index fixed.

  New features:
        - Use ~ as prefix for plugins or action classes which are located in
          MyApp::Plugin / MyApp::Action (mo)
        - Controller methods without attributes are now considered actions if
          they are specified in config->{action(s)} (mo)
        - Add Catalyst::Component::ContextClosure as an easy way to create code
          references, that close over the context, without creating leaks.

  Refactoring / cleanups:
        - Clean namespaces in Catalyst::Exception*.
        - Turn Catalyst::Exception into an actual class and make the throw
          method create instances of it. They can still be used as normal
          strings, as before, as they are overloaded to stringify to their
          error message.
        - Add a rethrow method to Catalyst::Exception.
        - Add Catalyst::Exception::Detach and ::Go, and refactor detach() and
          go() to use them instead of magic, global strings.
          Fixes RT#47366
        - Clean up getting metaclass instance and making app class immutable
          again in Catalyst::Test

5.80005 2009-06-06 14:40:00

  Behaviour changes:
        - Arguments ($c->req->args) in Chained dispatch are now automatically
          URL decoded to be consistent with Local/Path dispatch

  Documentation:
        - Clarify correct techniques for Moose controllers (domm)

  Bug fixes:
        - Further change pushing 'env' attribute down into Catalyst::Engine
          to make $c->engine->env work in all cases (kmx)
        - Also fix $c->engine->env in Catalyst::Test tests (kmx)
          - Tests for this
        - Fix Catalyst failing to start if any plugin changed $_ whilst
          loading
          - Tests for this
        - Be stricter about arguments to Args attributes for Chained actions,
          so that they blow up on load instead of causing undefined behavior
          later on
          - Tests for this
        - Prefer Path actions with a smaller (or set) number of Args (caelum)
          Bug reported here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/931653/catalyst-action-that-matches-a-single-file-in-the-root-directory/933181#933181
          - Tests for this

   New features:
        - Add $c->req->remote_user to disambiguate from $c->req->user (dwc)
        - Require MooseX::MethodAttributes 0.12 so that action methods
          (with attributes) can be used in / composed from Moose roles.
        - Allow the generation of cookies with the HTTPOnly flag set
          in Catalyst::Engine (kmx)

5.80004 2009-05-18 17:03:23
        - Rename the actions attribute in Catalyt::Controller to
          _controller_actions to avoid name clashes with application
          controller naming. (random)
        - Test for using Moose in components which have a non-Moose base class
          Fixed by 349cda in Moose 0.78
        - Fix deprecation message for Catalyst::Dispatcher to refer
          to the class actually calling the deprecated method. RT#45741
        - Clarify limitations of $request->base and $request->secure.
          (Phil Mitchell)
        - Add 'use Catalyst' to documentation for a Moose MyApp class as
          noted by dmaki.
        - Fix so that / (and other special characters) are URL encoded when
          passed into $c->uri_for as Args/CaptureArgs
        - Fix development server so that $c->engine->env returns the correct
          environment
        - Require Moose 0.78 to fix metaclass incompatibility issues
        - Require MooseX::MethodAttributes 0.10 and use
          Moose::Meta::Class->initialize rather than Moose->init_meta to fix
          bugs related to having a 'meta' method in your controller
        - Fix cases where your application failing to compile could cause perl
          to report 'Unknown Error'
        - Support adding Moose::Roles to the plugin list. These are applied to
          MyApp after plugins have been pushed onto @ISA
        - Fix calling $c->req->parameters as the first thing you do when
          parse_on_demand is on

5.80003 2009-04-29 16:23:53
        - Various POD tweaks. (hdp, dandv)
        - Fix formatting error in the regex fallback warning.
        - Convert the dispatcher's and restarter engine's BUILD method to
          attribute builders to not override the BUILD method from
          MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast.
        - Fix classes without metaclasses restarting, when not using
          B::Hooks::OP::Check::StashChange
        - Fix the unattached chain debug table for endpoints with no
          parents at all.
        - Turn off test aggregation by default. Only aggregate if the
          AGGREGATE_TESTS environment variable is set and a recent
          Test::Aggregate is available.
        - Bump to MooseX::MethodAttributes 0.09, to gain the
          get_nearest_methods_with_attributes method allowing methods without
          attributes in a subclass to override those with attributes in a
          superclass. This fixes CatalystX::CRUD's method of overriding /
          disabling functionality from base controllers.
        - Bump HTTP::Request::AsCGI dependency to avoid broken version
        - Bump Moose dependency to latest version to fix metaclass
          incompatibility issues in some cases.
        - Additional tests for setup_stats method.
        - Fix log levels in Catalyst::Log to be properly additive.
        - Fix RT#43375 by sorting results before testing them
        - Fixes for uri_for_action when using Catalyst::DispatchType::Regex
          + tests from RT#39369 (norbi)
        - Partial rewrite and reoganisation of the C3 docs in
          Catalyst::Upgrading based on feedback from kiffin
        - If you make your application class immutable and turn off
          constructor inlining, Catalyst will die and tell you pass
          the (replace_constructor => 1) argument to
          make_immutable. (Dave Rolsky)

5.80002 2009-04-22 01:28:36
        - Fix CATALYST_DEBUG and MYAPP_DEBUG environment variables
          turning debuging on if defined, rather than if set.
          They now force debugging on or off, taking precedence over
          configuration in your application.
          - Tests for this
        - pass replace_constructor to the immutable call to ensure
          applications get a Moose constructor rather than a C::A one
        - Fix issues with restarting the application class due to C3 failures
          on perl 5.10

          has been made private
        - Fix so that calling $c->req->parameters(undef) does not flatten
          the request parameters with undef + test
        - Fix so that width of table of unattached actions for debugging
          ::DispatchType::Chained varies according to your terminal width
          (Oleg Kostyuk)
        - Fix warning message about linearized @ISA in Catalyst::Component
          (Emanuele Zeppieri)
        - Require MX::MethodAttributes 0.06 to avoid issues with saying
          use base 'Catalyst::Controller'; use Moose; losing actions
        - Fix all of's typos in ::Upgrading and ::Delta (hobbs)

5.80001 2009-04-18 22:18

        - Add the Catalyst::Dispatcher->dispatch_type method (ash)
        - Throw an exception rather than loading an app if an action

          - Tests for this
        - Change the $c->visit and $c->go methods to optionally take
          CaptureArgs, making them useful to call ActionChains with
          - Tests for this (radek)
        - Fix _invoke_as_component method to find the proper action instance
          for dispatchable actions so that ->visit or ->going to ActionChains
          with qw/Class::Name method_name/ works correctly
          - Tests for this (radek)
        - Added Catalyst::Test::ctx_request to be able to inspect
          the context object after a request is made (Jos Boumans)
        - debug() POD rewrite (jhannah)
        - Change the warning when you have conflicting components to
          present a list
        - Move NEXT use and testing deprecated features out to its own
          test application so that the main TestApp isn't polluted with
          spurious warnings
        - Add a warning for the old ::[MVC]:: style naming scheme
          - Test for this
        - Kill Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT warnings for the Catalyst:: namespace
          in production versions
        - Tidy up Catalyst::ClassData to ensure that all components get
          the correct metaclass
        - Make MyApp.pm restartable by unsetting setup_finished in
          the restarter process
        - Non-naive implementation of making mutable on restart using
          B::Hooks::OP::Check::StashChange if installed
          - Tests for this
        - Naive implementation of making all components mutable in the
          forked restart watcher process so native Moose apps using
          immutable restart correctly.
          - Tests for this
        - Bump Moose dependency to 0.70 so that we avoid nasty surprises
          with is_class_loaded and perl 5.80 when you Moosify MyApp.pm
        - Clarify that request arguments aren't unescaped automatically
          (Simon Bertrang) (Closes RT#41153)

          changes. Also depend on the latest Class::MOP.
        - Add $c->uri_for_action method.
        - Don't stringify the meta method. Use its name instead.
        - Use MooseX::MethodAttributes::Inheritable to contain action
          attributes. This means that attributes are now represented in the MOP,
          allowing method modifiers on actions to work as expected.
        - Provide a reasonable API in Catalyst::Controller for working with
          and registering actions, allowing a controller sub-class to replace
          subroutine attributes for action declerations with an alternate
          syntax.
        - Instantiate correct sub-class of Moose::Meta::Class for non-Moose
          components where Catalyst forces the creation of a metaclass instance.
          This is more correct, and avoids metaclass incompatibility in complex
          cases
          - Tests for this
        - Use of deprecated Catalyst::Base now warns.
        - Add uri_with tests

          method on the requests HTTP::Body instance
          - Test for this
        - Fix calling $c->req->body from inside an overridden prepare_action
          method in a plugin, as used by Catalyst::Plugin::Server
          - Test for this
        - Fix assignment to Catalyst::Dispatcher's preload_dispatch_types and
          postload_dispatch_types attributes - assigning a list should later
          return a listref. Fixes Catalyst::Plugin::Server.

          Sewn together by from two patches provided by David E. Wheeler
        - Switch an around 'new' in Catalyst::Controller to a BUILDARGS
          method as it's much neater and more obvious what is going on
        - Add a clearer method on request and response _context
          attributes, and use if from ::Engine rather than deleting

        - Add test case for the bug which is causing the
          Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication tests to fail

        - Use a predicate to avoid recursion in cases where the uri
          method is overridden by a plugin, and calls the base method,
          for example Catalyst::Plugin::SmartURI
          - Test for this (caelum)
        - Compose the MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast role to
          Catalyst::Action, Catalyst::Request, and all other modules which
          inherit from Class::Accessor::Fast in 5.70.

          objects

5.7099_01 2008-06-25 22:36:00
        - Refactored component resolution (component(), models(), model(), et al). We now
          throw warnings for two reasons:
          1) model() or view() was called with no arguments, and two results are returned
             -- set default_(model|view), current_(model|view) or current_(model|view)_instance
             instead
          2) you call a component resolution method with a string, and it resorts to a regexp
             fallback wherein a result is returned -- if you really want to search, call the
             method with a regex as the argument
        - remove 0-length query string components so warnings aren't thrown (RT #36428)

          an undef value (RT #34782)
        - Added $c->go, to do an internal redispatch to another action, while retaining the
          contents of the stash

          in SSL mode.
        - Removed unnecessary sprintf in debug mode that caused warnings on locales where
          commas are used for decimal markers.
        - Improved error message for case when server picks up editor save
          files as module names. (James Mastros)

        - Fixed issue where development server running in fork mode did not
          properly exit after a write error.

          would not be sent properly.

5.7007  2007-03-13 14:18:00
        - Many performance improvements by not using URI.pm:
          * $c->uri_for (approx. 8x faster)
          * $c->engine->prepare_path (approx. 27x faster)
          * $c->engine->prepare_query_parameters (approx. 5x faster)
        - Updated HTTP::Body dependency to 0.9 which fixes the following issues:
          * Handle when IE sometimes sends an extra CRLF after the POST body.
          * Empty fields in multipart/form-data POSTs are no longer ignored.
          * Uploaded files with the name "0" are no longer ignored.
        - Sending SIGHUP to the dev server will now cause it to restart.
        - Allow "0" for a path in uri_for.
        - Performance and stability improvements to the built-in HTTP server.
        - Don't ignore file uploads if form contains a text field with the same name.
          (Carl Franks)
        - Support restart_delay of 0 (for use in the POE engine).
        - Skip body processing if we don't have a Content-Length header.
          Results in about a 9% performance increase when handling GET/HEAD
          requests.
        - Add a default body to redirect responses.
        - MyApp->model/view now looks at MyApp->config->{default_view/model}
