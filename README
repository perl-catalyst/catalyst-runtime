DESCRIPTION
    The key concept of Catalyst is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

    See Catalyst::Manual for more documentation.

    Catalyst plugins can be loaded by naming them as arguments to the "use
    Catalyst" statement. Omit the "Catalyst::Plugin::" prefix from the
    plugin name, i.e., "Catalyst::Plugin::My::Module" becomes "My::Module".

        use Catalyst qw/My::Module/;

    Special flags like -Debug and -Engine can also be specified as arguments
    when Catalyst is loaded:

        use Catalyst qw/-Debug My::Module/;

    The position of plugins and flags in the chain is important, because
    they are loaded in exactly the order that they appear.

    The following flags are supported:

    -Debug
        Enables debug output.

    -Engine
        Forces Catalyst to use a specific engine. Omit the
        "Catalyst::Engine::" prefix of the engine name, i.e.:

            use Catalyst qw/-Engine=CGI/;

    -Home
        Forces Catalyst to use a specific home directory.

    -Log
        Specifies log level.

METHODS
  Information about the current request
    $c->action
        Returns a Catalyst::Action object for the current action, which
        stringifies to the action name.

    $c->namespace
        Returns the namespace of the current action, i.e., the uri prefix
        corresponding to the controller of the current action.

    $c->request
    $c->req
        Returns the current Catalyst::Request object.

  Processing and response to the current request
    $c->forward( $action [, \@arguments ] )
    $c->forward( $class, $method, [, \@arguments ] )
        Forwards processing to a private action. If you give a class name
        but no method, process() is called. You may also optionally pass
        arguments in an arrayref. The action will receive the arguments in
        @_ and $c->req->args. Upon returning from the function,
        $c->req->args will be restored to the previous values.

            $c->forward('/foo');
            $c->forward('index');
            $c->forward(qw/MyApp::Model::CDBI::Foo do_stuff/);
            $c->forward('MyApp::View::TT');

    $c->detach( $action [, \@arguments ] )
    $c->detach( $class, $method, [, \@arguments ] )
        The same as "forward", but doesn't return.

    $c->error
    $c->error($error, ...)
    $c->error($arrayref)
        Returns an arrayref containing error messages.

            my @error = @{ $c->error };

        Add a new error.

            $c->error('Something bad happened');

        Clear errors.

            $c->error(0);

    $c->response
    $c->res
        Returns the current Catalyst::Response object.

    $c->stash
        Returns a hashref to the stash, which may be used to store data and
        pass it between components. You can also set hash keys by passing
        arguments. The stash is automatically sent to the view.

            $c->stash->{foo} = $bar;
            $c->stash( { moose => 'majestic', qux => 0 } );
            $c->stash( bar => 1, gorch => 2 ); # equivalent to passing a hashref
    
            # stash is automatically passed to the view for use in a template
            $c->forward( 'MyApp::V::TT' );

    $c->state
        Contains the return value of the last executed action.

  Component Accessors
    $c->comp($name)
    $c->component($name)
        Gets a component object by name. This method is no longer
        recommended. $c->controller, $c->model, and $c->view should be used
        instead.

    $c->controller($name)
        Gets a Catalyst::Controller instance by name.

            $c->controller('Foo')->do_stuff;

    $c->model($name)
        Gets a Catalyst::Model instance by name.

            $c->model('Foo')->do_stuff;

    $c->view($name)
        Gets a Catalyst::View instance by name.

            $c->view('Foo')->do_stuff;

  Class data and helper classes
    $c->config
        Returns or takes a hashref containing the application's
        configuration.

            __PACKAGE__->config({ db => 'dsn:SQLite:foo.db' });

    $c->debug
        Overload to enable debug messages (same as -Debug option).

    $c->dispatcher
        Returns the dispatcher instance. Stringifies to class name.

    $c->engine
        Returns the engine instance. Stringifies to the class name.

    $c->log
        Returns the logging object instance. Unless it is already set,
        Catalyst sets this up with a Catalyst::Log object. To use your own
        log class:

            $c->log( MyLogger->new );
            $c->log->info( 'now logging with my own logger!' );

        Your log class should implement the methods described in the
        Catalyst::Log man page.

  Utility methods
    $c->path_to(@path)
        Merges @path with $c->config->{home} and returns a Path::Class
        object.

        For example:

            $c->path_to( 'db', 'sqlite.db' );

    $c->plugin( $name, $class, @args )
        Helper method for plugins. It creates a classdata accessor/mutator
        and loads and instantiates the given class.

            MyApp->plugin( 'prototype', 'HTML::Prototype' );

            $c->prototype->define_javascript_functions;

    MyApp->setup
        Initializes the dispatcher and engine, loads any plugins, and loads
        the model, view, and controller components. You may also specify an
        array of plugins to load here, if you choose to not load them in the
        "use Catalyst" line.

            MyApp->setup;
            MyApp->setup( qw/-Debug/ );

    $c->uri_for( $path, [ @args ] )
        Merges path with $c->request->base for absolute uri's and with
        $c->request->match for relative uri's, then returns a normalized URI
        object. If any args are passed, they are added at the end of the
        path.

    $c->welcome_message
        Returns the Catalyst welcome HTML page.

INTERNAL METHODS
    $c->benchmark( $coderef )
        Takes a coderef with arguments and returns elapsed time as float.

            my ( $elapsed, $status ) = $c->benchmark( sub { return 1 } );
            $c->log->info( sprintf "Processing took %f seconds", $elapsed );

    $c->components
        Returns a hash of components.

    $c->context_class
        Returns or sets the context class.

    $c->counter
        Returns a hashref containing coderefs and execution counts (needed
        for deep recursion detection).

    $c->depth
        Returns the number of actions on the current internal execution
        stack.

    $c->dispatch
        Dispatches a request to actions.

    $c->dispatcher_class
        Returns or sets the dispatcher class.

    $c->dump_these
        Returns a list of 2-element array references (name, structure) pairs
        that will be dumped on the error page in debug mode.

    $c->engine_class
        Returns or sets the engine class.

    $c->execute( $class, $coderef )
        Execute a coderef in given class and catch exceptions. Errors are
        available via $c->error.

    $c->finalize
        Finalizes the request.

    $c->finalize_body
        Finalizes body.

    $c->finalize_cookies
        Finalizes cookies.

    $c->finalize_error
        Finalizes error.

    $c->finalize_headers
        Finalizes headers.

    $c->finalize_output
        An alias for finalize_body.

    $c->finalize_read
        Finalizes the input after reading is complete.

    $c->finalize_uploads
        Finalizes uploads. Cleans up any temporary files.

    $c->get_action( $action, $namespace )
        Gets an action in a given namespace.

    $c->get_actions( $action, $namespace )
        Gets all actions of a given name in a namespace and all parent
        namespaces.

    handle_request( $class, @arguments )
        Called to handle each HTTP request.

    $c->prepare( @arguments )
        Creates a Catalyst context from an engine-specific request (Apache,
        CGI, etc.).

    $c->prepare_action
        Prepares action.

    $c->prepare_body
        Prepares message body.

    $c->prepare_body_chunk( $chunk )

    $c->response_class
        Returns or sets the response class.

    $c->read( [$maxlength] )
        Reads a chunk of data from the request body. This method is designed
        to be used in a while loop, reading $maxlength bytes on every call.
        $maxlength defaults to the size of the request if not specified.

        You have to set MyApp->config->{parse_on_demand} to use this
        directly.

    $c->run
        Starts the engine.

    $c->set_action( $action, $code, $namespace, $attrs )
        Sets an action in a given namespace.

    $c->setup_plugins
    $c->stack
        Returns the stack.

    $c->write( $data )
        Writes $data to the output stream. When using this method directly,
        you will need to manually set the Content-Length header to the
        length of your output data, if known.

    version
        Returns the Catalyst version number. Mostly useful for "powered by"
        messages in template systems.

INTERNAL ACTIONS
    Catalyst uses internal actions like "_DISPATCH", "_BEGIN", "_AUTO"
    "_ACTION" and "_END". These are by default not shown in the private
    action table, but you can make them visible with a config parameter.

        MyApp->config->{show_internal_actions} = 1;

CASE SENSITIVITY
    By default Catalyst is not case sensitive, so "MyApp::C::FOO::Bar" is
    mapped to "/foo/bar". You can activate case sensitivity with a config
    parameter.

        MyApp->config->{case_sensitive} = 1;

    This causes "MyApp::C::Foo::Bar" to map to "/Foo/Bar".

ON-DEMAND PARSER
    The request body is usually parsed at the beginning of a request, but if
    you want to handle input yourself or speed things up a bit, you can
    enable on-demand parsing with a config parameter.

        MyApp->config->{parse_on_demand} = 1;
    
PROXY SUPPORT
    Many production servers operate using the common double-server approach,
    with a lightweight frontend web server passing requests to a larger
    backend server. An application running on the backend server must deal
    with two problems: the remote user always appears to be 127.0.0.1 and
    the server's hostname will appear to be "localhost" regardless of the
    virtual host that the user connected through.

    Catalyst will automatically detect this situation when you are running
    the frontend and backend servers on the same machine. The following
    changes are made to the request.

        $c->req->address is set to the user's real IP address, as read from the
        HTTP X-Forwarded-For header.
    
        The host value for $c->req->base and $c->req->uri is set to the real host,
        as read from the HTTP X-Forwarded-Host header.

    Obviously, your web server must support these headers for this to work.

    In a more complex server farm environment where you may have your
    frontend proxy server(s) on different machines, you will need to set a
    configuration option to tell Catalyst to read the proxied data from the
    headers.

        MyApp->config->{using_frontend_proxy} = 1;
    
    If you do not wish to use the proxy support at all, you may set:

        MyApp->config->{ignore_frontend_proxy} = 1;

THREAD SAFETY
    Catalyst has been tested under Apache 2's threading mpm_worker,
    mpm_winnt, and the standalone forking HTTP server on Windows. We believe
    the Catalyst core to be thread-safe.

    If you plan to operate in a threaded environment, remember that all
    other modules you are using must also be thread-safe. Some modules, most
    notably DBD::SQLite, are not thread-safe.
