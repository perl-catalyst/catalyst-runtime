Catalyst-Runtime
================
This is the Runtime distribution for the Catalyst MVC framework.
For more information about Catalyst, write

$ perldoc Catalyst

at the command line, or visit http://www.catalystframework.org/.
You can also install Catalyst::Manual from CPAN for more
comprehensive information.

If you are going to write your own Catalyst application, you will
need to install Catalyst::Devel. Having done that, see catalyst.pl
for more information about creating your first app.
