DESCRIPTION
    Catalyst is based upon Maypole, which you should consider for smaller
    projects.

    The key concept of Catalyst is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

    See Catalyst::Manual for more documentation.

    Omit the Catalyst::Plugin:: prefix from plugins. So
    Catalyst::Plugin::My::Module becomes My::Module.

        use Catalyst 'My::Module';

    You can also set special flags like -Debug and -Engine.

        use Catalyst qw/-Debug My::Module/;

    The position of plugins and flags in the chain is important, because
    they are loaded in the same order they appear.

  -Debug
        use Catalyst '-Debug';

    is equivalent to

        use Catalyst;
        sub debug { 1 }

  -Engine
    Force Catalyst to use a specific engine. Omit the Catalyst::Engine::
    prefix.

        use Catalyst '-Engine=CGI';

  METHODS
   debug
    Overload to enable debug messages.

   config
    Returns a hashref containing your applications settings.
