=head1 DESCRIPTION

currently dispatched action via $c->action. See the L<Catalyst::Dispatcher>
for more information on how actions are dispatched. Actions are defined in
L<Catalyst::Controller> subclasses.

=head2 code

Returns a code reference to this action.

=head2 dispatch( $c )

Dispatch this action against a context

=head2 execute( $controller, $c, @args )

context and arguments

=head2 match( $c )

Check Args attribute, and makes sure number of args matches the setting.
