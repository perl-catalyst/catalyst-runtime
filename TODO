TBD pre 5.8000_04 dev release:

  - Go through everything which used to use CAF, and ensure that it now uses MX::E::CAF + tests, 
    extending t/caf_backcompat.t and replacing t/custom_request.t (t0m)

  - Simple test for NEXT compat in core (t0m).

  - Looks like stash is not available during prepare_path when running under
    Catalyst::Test.. Run MojoMojo's t/01app.t and it will explode with
    "Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference" - test case for core
    + fix maybe (marcus)

---

  - Make the skipped test at the bottom of t/aggregate/live_engine_request_uri.t
    pass / not be skipped. (From what C::P::SmartURI used to do)

    This can be fixed by the following patch:

     my $self = shift;
-    return $self->path if $self->uri;

   },
 );

    But I'd like a 2nd opinion from someone who knows core better than me
    about if that is the correct fix.. (t0m / Caelum)

  - Common engine test failures, look into and get tests into core.

  - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL, Can't locate object method "tree" via package "Catalyst::Dispatcher", fix the plugin as tree was never a public method.

  - Catalyst-Model-Akismet, incorrectly inherits from Catalyst::Component::InstancePerContext, should compose as a role, fix the module.

  - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol table as methods, tests + fix?

  - Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Curried
  - Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI
    - Both import 'meta' into controller package - mst thinks this can be fixed?.
      but @marcus> and the generated accessors even call $_[0]->meta, so I don't think we can remove it. 
      . Add a test for this in core.
      . Fix core to use CMOP to look up metaclass, rather than ->meta method, and
        namespace::clean the meta method out, fix generated accessors to do the same?

  - MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast
    - Tests for uses of C::A::F from Catalyst repos. - t0m
    - New release once these are done.

  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages when you do it as well as how to fix it. (done already?)
  
  - Comments marked /Moose TODO/i in the code
  
  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}

  - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl - deep recursion in the test suite, investigate

  - Profiling vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

  - http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/catalyst-dev/2008-November/001546.html
    - patch to list, andyg to look at?
