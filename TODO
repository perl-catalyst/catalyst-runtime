Back-compat investigation / known issues:

  - Get engines tested:
    - Catalyst-Engine-Zeus
    - Catalyst-Engine-XMPP2
    - Catalyst-Engine-HTTPEngine
    - Catalyst-Engine-HTTP-Prefork
    - Catalyst-Engine-SCGI
    - Catalyst-Engine-Wx

  - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol 
    table as methods, tests + fix, or explanation and documentation?
    (rafl & phaylon)

  - Run another round of repository smokes against latest 5.80 trunk, manually
    go through all the things which are broken (t0m).
    
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Session-State-Cookie
       Catalyst-Plugin-Session-Store-FastMmap
       Catalyst-Plugin-Session-PerUser
       Catalyst-Plugin-Session-Store-File
       Catalyst-Authentication-Credential-HTTP
       Catalyst-Plugin-SmartURI
        - All fixed by Scope::Upper
     
     - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl Deep recursion on subroutine "MockApp::setup" 
       (rafl)
     
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Cache dies due to mk_accessors('meta')
     
     - CatalystX-CRUD and CatalystX-CRUD-ModelAdapter-DBIC
       fail tests against 5.80 (karpet)

     - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL fails as 
       Catalyst::Dispatcher::_do_forward does not fix arguments if you throw
       an exception. Needs a test case (Caelum)
     
     - Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication new release.

  - Issues with TWMC not being loaded when it used to be in 5.70 
    (Bill Moseley)

  - Fix memory leaks (I already tried Devel::Leak::Object, but no joy).

  -  In 5.70, you can have a component which doesn't inherit from ::Component, 
     and has no new method, and it'll do the right thing for you. We should 
     still support that, but warn for/deprecate it so it can go for 5.9X...
     This obviously needs better tests :/

Cleanups:

  - Allow turning deprecated warnings off with use Catalyst 
    qw/-NoDeprecationWarnings/

  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages 
      when you do it as well as how to fix it.

  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}, I think the only thing
    left is lib/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm: $self->{inputbuf}, which I haven't
    touched as it is used as an lvalue in a lot of places (t0m)

  - Find whatever in the test suite craps a file called GLOB(0xfoo) onto my 
    disk and fix it. (Believed to be in the optional TEST_HTTP tests?) (t0m)

Documentation:

   - extends in components with attributes must be inside a BEGIN block.

   - How to write Moosified Catalyst components.

   - Manual / Tutorial updates

   - Fix the Roadmap to be less full of lies.

   -  With 5.7 people did extends qw/Moose::Object Catalyst::Component/, now 
      Catalyst::Component isa Moose::Object so now isa doesn't linearize 
      anymore, docs of what doesn't work and why (rafl)

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

Tests:

  - Moosified test application?

  - Test warning from back-compat methods in Catalyst::Dispatcher
  
  - Test warnings from plugin method on Catalyst
