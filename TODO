Known Bugs:

   - Bug ->go or ->visit causes actions which have Args or CaptureArgs caled
     twice when called via ->go or ->visit.

     Test app: http://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-bug-go_chain/tree/master


   - Certain errors in your application to do with using other code which does
     not exist can cause an 'Unknown error' issue.

     This is now fixed, by moving back to B::Hooks::EndOfScope, but this (used
     to) cause issues with the following modules:

     - Catalyst-Plugin-Session-State-Cookie
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Session-Store-FastMmap
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Session-PerUser
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Session-Store-File
     - Catalyst-Authentication-Credential-HTTP
     - Catalyst-Plugin-SmartURI

     according to comments in r8991. Retest these before shipping anything..

   - -restarter.t will fail if you don't have ::StashChange installed, and
      also quite often at other times.


   - Catalyst::Test - bugs with Moosification (Khisanth/kane)

   - Attribute called 'actions' in controllers - needs to be renamed to _actions.

   - before finalize causes you to miserably fail to call plugins finalize
     method (dmaki)

Compatibility warnings to add:

   - $self->config should warn as config should only ever be called as a
     class method.

Proposed functionality / feature additions:

    - Log setup needs to be less lame, so Catalyst::Plugin::Log::* can die
      in a fire. Having $c->log_class would be a good start. kane volunteered
      to do some of this.

      Simple example: Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Colorful should just be a
      subclass of Catalyst::Log, no ::Plugin:: needed.
