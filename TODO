Pending patches:
  - meta test for MX::Emulate::CAF needed by Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Curried

Back-compat investigation / known issues:

  - Common engine test failures, look into and get tests into core.

  - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol 
    table as methods, tests + fix, or explanation and documentation?
    (rafl & phaylon)

  - Run another round of repository smokes against latest 5.80 trunk, manually
    go through all the things which are broken (t0m).
    
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Server dies due to "package is not defined" error
       which was reduced to a warning, retest.
    
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Cache dies due to mk_accessors('meta')
    
     - Catalyst-Action-REST appears to have real issues, investigate
    
     - Catalyst-Model-Search ditto
     
     - CatalystX-CRUD ditto
    
     - Catalyst-Engine-Apache - Deep recursion on subroutine 
       "Catalyst::Action::execute", investigate once all other tests pass
    
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Scheduler
     - Catalyst-Engine-HTTPEngine
     - Catalyst-View-HTML-Template
     - Catalyst-View-XSLT
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Setenv
     - Catalyst-Plugin-RequireSSL - Bullshit 'cannot locate' errors
                                    Bug in smoke test rig.
                                    
     - Catalyst::Plugin::HTML::Widget - Undefined subroutine 
       &HTML::Widget::Result::attributes called at 
       lib/perl5/HTML/Widget/Result.pm line 68.

  - Issues with TWMC not being loaded when it used to be in 5.70 
    (Bill Moseley)

  - Fix memory leaks (I already tried Devel::Leak::Object, but no joy).

  -  In 5.70, you can have a component which doesn't inherit from ::Component, 
     and has no new method, and it'll do the right thing for you. We just 
     ignore that, we should still support that, but warn for/deprecate it so 
     it can go for 5.9X...
     This all obviously needs better tests :/

Cleanups:

  - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL, Can't locate object method "tree" 
    via package "Catalyst::Dispatcher", fix the plugin as tree was never 
    a public method.

  - Catalyst-Model-Akismet, incorrectly inherits from 
    Catalyst::Component::InstancePerContext, should compose as a role. 
    Fix the module.
    
  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages 
      when you do it as well as how to fix it. (done already?)

  - Comments marked /Moose TODO/i in Catalyst::Request re {_body} (t0m)

  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}, I think the only thing
    left is lib/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm: $self->{inputbuf}, which I haven't
    touched as it is used as an lvalue in a lot of places (t0m)

  - Find whatever in the test suite craps a file called GLOB(0xfoo) onto my 
    disk and fix it. (Believed to be in the optional tests?) (t0m)

Documentation:

   - extends in components must be inside a BEGIN block.

   - How to write Moosified Catalyst components.

   - Manual / Tutorial updates

   - Fix the Roadmap to be less full of lies.

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

Tests:

  - Moosified test application?
