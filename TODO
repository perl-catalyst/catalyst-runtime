Pending patches:
  - meta test for MX::Emulate::CAF needed by Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Curried
  
  - Bump MX::Emulate::CAF for fixes to t/double_apply.t 
  
Back-compat investigation / known issues:

  - Plugins with new methods.
    - Moose 'not inlining new method' warnings need to be fixed.
      - Warning in Moose could also be more helpful..
    - Why does the current test not fail / warn?
    - Generally unhappy with the on_end_of_scope immutable approach,
      try removing new method from plugins (and emitting warning).

  - Common engine test failures, look into and get tests into core.

  - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol 
    table as methods, tests + fix, or explanation and documentation?
    (rafl & phaylon)

  - Run another round of repository smokes against latest 5.80 trunk, manually
    go through all the things which are broken (t0m).
    
     - Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL
     - Catalyst::Plugin::Server
     - Catalyst::Plugin::HTML::Widget
       - Should hopefully be fixed now..
     
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Cache dies due to mk_accessors('meta')
    
     - Catalyst-Action-REST appears to have real issues, investigate
    
     - Catalyst-Model-Search ditto
     
     - CatalystX-CRUD ditto
    
     - Catalyst-Engine-Apache - Deep recursion on subroutine 
       "Catalyst::Action::execute", investigate once all other tests pass
    
  - Issues with TWMC not being loaded when it used to be in 5.70 
    (Bill Moseley)

  - Fix memory leaks (I already tried Devel::Leak::Object, but no joy).

  -  In 5.70, you can have a component which doesn't inherit from ::Component, 
     and has no new method, and it'll do the right thing for you. We just 
     ignore that, we should still support that, but warn for/deprecate it so 
     it can go for 5.9X...
     This all obviously needs better tests :/

Cleanups:
    
  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages 
      when you do it as well as how to fix it.

  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}, I think the only thing
    left is lib/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm: $self->{inputbuf}, which I haven't
    touched as it is used as an lvalue in a lot of places (t0m)

  - Find whatever in the test suite craps a file called GLOB(0xfoo) onto my 
    disk and fix it. (Believed to be in the optional TEST_HTTP tests?) (t0m)

Documentation:

   - extends in components must be inside a BEGIN block.

   - How to write Moosified Catalyst components.

   - Manual / Tutorial updates

   - Fix the Roadmap to be less full of lies.

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

Tests:

  - Moosified test application?

  - Test warning from back-compat methods in Catalyst::Dispatcher
