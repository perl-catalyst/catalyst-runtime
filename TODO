Back-compat investigation:

  - Get engines tested:
    - Catalyst-Engine-Zeus
    - Catalyst-Engine-XMPP2
    - Catalyst-Engine-HTTPEngine
    - Catalyst-Engine-HTTP-Prefork
    - Catalyst-Engine-Wx

Known issues:

     - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl Deep recursion on subroutine "MockApp::setup" due
       to Adopt::NEXT not remembering which setup methods were already called
       and which not, like NEXT does. Log::Log4perl needs to be fixed and the
       problem should be described in Upgrading.pod. (rafl)

     - CatalystX-CRUD and CatalystX-CRUD-ModelAdapter-DBIC
       fail tests against 5.80 (karpet)

     - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL fails as 
       Catalyst::Dispatcher::_do_forward does not fix arguments if you throw
       an exception. Needs a test case (Caelum)
     
     - Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication new release.
     
     - Catalyst::Action::RenderView
     - Catalyst::Plugin::DebugCookie
       - Conflict with each other: $c->config->{debug}->{foo} = 'bar'
         now breaks, unsure why..

Cleanups:

18:01 <@mst> hmm. I think that warning should show what it found
18:01 <@mst> and say "you probably called ->model("Sessions") when you meant ->model("DB::Sessions")" or whatever
18:05 <@mst> unsafe_component_use_ok
18:05 <@mst> like we did for BindLex



  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages 
      when you do it as well as how to fix it.

  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}, I think the only thing
    left is lib/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm: $self->{inputbuf}, which I haven't
    touched as it is used as an lvalue in a lot of places (t0m)

  - Find whatever in the test suite craps a file called GLOB(0xfoo) onto my 
    disk and fix it. (Believed to be in the optional TEST_HTTP tests?) (t0m)

     (Bill Moseley)

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.
