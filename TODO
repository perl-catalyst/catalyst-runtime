Known issues:

Documentation:

   - Catalyst/Upgrading.pod needs brushing up

   - Warning when you pass $c->model("MyApp::Model::Foo") is the generic
     warning for regex fall back. Should be more specific about what you
     screwed up, and the docs for $c->model should be more explicit about
     what is expected. This probably also applies to view/controller.

   - Run more smokes

   - Test/document ->Class::MOP::Object::meta call in ::ClassData

   - Change dispatcher and upgrade docs appropriately (no new method needed)

   - Using anything ::[CMV]:: should warn (once, on boot).

   - TestApp should not use NEXT. There should be a TestAppNEXTCompat
     which does but is standalone..

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed on perl 5.8 (5.10 is already faster!).
