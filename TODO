  - Get rid of Class::Inspector. Class::MOP has 'is_class_loaded' and
    'load_class', which is all we use Class::Inspector for.

  - Make Catalyst::Test use Sub::Exporter or maybe Moose::Exporter.

  - Add Class::Accessor compats
    * Catalyst::Request
    * Catalyst::Response
    * Catalyst::Dispatcher
    * Catalyst::Request::Upload
    * Catalyst::Action
    * Catalyst::ActionChain
    * Catalyst::ActionContainer

  - Make classes immutable at setup() time


  - GRODITI's list:
    * Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
      - After that I'll set up attr handlers that will output helpful
        error messages when you do it as well as how to fix it.
    * comments marked /Moose TODO/i in the code
    * Fix the CDI compat hack so we can start moving to immutable
    * Profile before and after immutable.
    * Now would be a good time to lay ground for the App / Ctx split
    * Howto mantain branch in sync with the latest checkins ?
    * Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}
    * MooseX::Emulate::CAF seems to be working like a charm :)
    * General code cleanups can't hurt
    * How do we move from NEXT to C3 ? I have never used either of them
      - What does the lineraized mro look like when we are using moose 
        method modifiers?
        - Does they all get clumped together or what? Is it a non-issue?
